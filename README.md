Description of portfolio website, including: 

- purpose:
The purpose of this portfolio website was to create a website to showcase myself as a Web Developer, and a professional in the field of IT. The portfolio website includes information about myself, such as my contact details, the tech stack I am familiar with, blog posts, a resume, and any other information about me relating to both soft skills and hard technical skills.

- functionality/features:

- sitemap:
My website sitemap uses a very basic layout which features the four main pages of my website - the home page, about me page, blog page, and contact page. Through the use of a navigation button (available on all pages), the user is able to navigate between these four main pages with ease. 

Through the blog page (mentioned above), the user can also access a further five web pages which are five separate blog posts (as per the assignment rubric). Within these five pages, the user is able to easily navigate between all five blog posts with the help of conveniently placed "previous post" and "next post" buttons at the top of every blog post. Moreover, the navigation button (used in the four main pages) is also placed at the top of every blog post to allow the user to move back to any of the four main pages if they wish to do so. 

This basic layout allows users to move back and forth between all pages throughout the website with as little inconvenience as possible.

- target audience:
The target audience for this website is a potential employer looking to engage myself as a developer for potential job positions. 

- tech stack:
The tech stack used throughout this website is a combination of HTML and CSS, and Netlify was used to deploy the website. 

(HTML)
HTML was used to produce the basic skeleton of the website, and to also include links, images, and text where necessary. Moreover, HTML was used to implement semantic elements throughout the website to allow for cater for accessibility, and "alt" tags were used where necessary to provide descriptions of images.

(CSS)
CSS was used for all styling of the website, which included the background, fonts, text colour, text spacing, borders, padding, margins, text and box shadows, animations, width and height of all components, and of course, flexbox and grid. 

(Nelitfy)
Netlify was used for the deployment of the website, and the actual source of the website came from Github. My Github repo was connected to my Netlify account, and Netlify used my Github repo to deploy the website.
