# James McGregor Portfolio Website - T1A2


Website: www.jamesmcdev.com

Github: www.github.com/james-mcgregor100/finalportfolio

# Purpose:
The purpose of this portfolio website was to create a website to showcase myself as a Web Developer, and a professional in the field of IT. I was tasked with creating a website which was responsive, using flexbox and/or grid on each html page. Moreover, the purpose was to create a website that would showcase my abilities as a developer, and to grab the attention of the user who lands on my home page. Therefore, I set out to design a website that was both a professional website to show to potential employers, but to also show off my own unique personality through the colours, features, overall styling deployed throughout the website. 

# Functionality/Features:
The website features 10 individual html pages, including - 

1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Blog Page
4. Blog Post 1
5. Blog Post 2
6. Blog Post 3
7. Blog Post 4
8. Blog Post 5
9. Projects
10. Contact Me

The website features a number of recurring components which are similarly styled, and positioned, on all html pages throughout the website. There are also individual components which are found on specific html pages throughout the site. These features are outlined below. 

## Component 1: Navigation Menu
The navigation menu is featured on every html page on the website. On the home page, the navigation menu is displayed horizontally, which reduces any excessive empty space on the page to ensure the reader's attention is fixated on the navigation bar. 

Aside from the home page, the navigation bar is used as a drop down menu just below the page heading at the top of every page. This allows for the reader to easily locate the menu, and allows the reader to easily navigate with ease to the other pages throughout the website. The dropdown menu feature has been used as a way to save space on the website, which allows for the main content on each page to grab the reader's attention.

The navigation menu was implemented and positioned on the page using flexbox on every page of the website. 

## Component 2: Footer (Social Media Buttons + Copyright)
The footer has been positioned at the bottom of every page throughout the website. It includes a group of three social media buttons which are linked to my social media profiles, including Twitter, Github, and Linkedin. For the purposes of adding extra styling, and wanting to add an element of fun, I added a very simple "hover" function to the social media buttons on every page. Once the user hovers their mouse over the buttons, the buttons do a very quick 360 degree spin (please refer to live website on desktop to experience this function).

The copyright component was added in the footer directly below the social media buttons.

Flexbox was used on the footer to control its positiong on every page of the website. 

## Component 3: Blog Post Navigation Buttons
On the pages Blog 1, Blog 2, Blog 3, Blog 4, Blog 5, there are "previous post" and "next post" buttons located above the beginning of each blog post. These buttons have active page links and are an essential component of the page as it allows the user to switch back and forth between each individual blog post, without having to return to the main "Blog Home" page. This component has been added to increase accessibility, and to provide convenience for the user.

## Component 4: Link to Resume Download
On the "About Me" page a line of text is inserted directly below the navigation menu at the top of the page to allow users to download and read my professional resume. This link is active, and it has arrows on either side of the text which indicate to the reader that they can click on this text link to view my resume. 

## Component 5: Image Links to Five Blog Posts
The "Blog" home page which is the landing page for the five individual blog posts, has five separate links, which are in the form of images and text. The five images are the direct links to the five individual blog pages, and they 

## Component 6: Contact Form 
The Contact Page features a contact form component, which calls the user to action by filling out their details in the contact form and sending the website owner a message, if the user wishes to do so. 

## Component 7: Mobile Phone and Email Address Buttons
On the Contact page there are two clickable buttons, for my mobile phone number and email address. By clicking these links the user will be able to make a direct phone call to me, or send an email to me directly. These links are incorporated in the website to provide the user with the various ways of contacting me, depending on their preferred method.




## Styling























# Sitemap:
My website sitemap uses a very basic layout which features the four main pages of my website - the home page, about me page, blog page, and contact page. Through the use of a navigation button (available on all pages), the user is able to navigate between these four main pages with ease. 

Through the blog page (mentioned above), the user can also access a further five web pages which are five separate blog posts (as per the assignment rubric). Within these five pages, the user is able to easily navigate between all five blog posts with the help of conveniently placed "previous post" and "next post" buttons at the top of every blog post. Moreover, the navigation button (used in the four main pages) is also placed at the top of every blog post to allow the user to move back to any of the four main pages if they wish to do so. 

This basic layout allows users to move back and forth between all pages throughout the website with as little inconvenience as possible.
